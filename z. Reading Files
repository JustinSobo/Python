# PLACE BOTH FILES IN SAME DIRECTORY (FOR THIS EXAMPLE..)

# FILE 1:

Vel - Administrator
Adam - Technician
Justin - Technician

# FILE 2:

# Read:           open("employees.txt", "r")
# Write:          open("employees.txt", "w")
# Append:         open("employees.txt", "a")
# Read & Write:   open("employees.txt", "r+")
# Ensure you close a file after opening it. Example below.

employee_file = open("employees", "r")

# print(employee_file.readable())
# print(employee_file.read())
# print(employee_file.readline())
# print(employee_file.readlines())
# print(employee_file.readlines()[1])
